# hangman_game
Very simple hangman game written in python.

## The Game
The game is played just like the classic hangman game everyone used to play in school. When the game starts the player is told the category in which the secret word is in. After that he is allowed to start guessing. A guess consists of only a letter or the number 1(if the player has the intention to guess the entire word).

The player is allowed to fail 6 times before the game returns "game over". In addition the game shows a visual representation of the hangman in the end of every try.
