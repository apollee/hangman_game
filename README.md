# hangman_game
Very simple hangman game written in python.

## The Game
The game is played just like the classic hangman game everyone used to play in school. A guess consists of only a letter and the player is allowed to fail 6 times before the game returns "game over". In addition the game shows a visual representation of the hangman in the end of every try.

## Things that I inted to had to the game
- Category of the secret word
- Option to guess the entire word

## Note about the amount of secret words
Right now the amount of secret words is very limited for debugging purposes but as soon as the game reaches its final version more words will be added.
