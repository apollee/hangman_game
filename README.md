# hangman_game
Very simple hangman game written in python.

## The Game
The game is played just like the classic hangman game everyone used to play in school. A guess consists of only a letter and the player is allowed to fail 6 times before the game returns "game over". In addition the game shows a visual representation of the hangman in the end of every try.
